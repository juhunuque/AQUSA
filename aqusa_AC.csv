""As a German associate, I need to be able to provide and invoice/credit report to my external accountant, so that their system data matches GP data. Germany - As you may know we are working with an external accountant who is working with DATEV. He imports all our invoices and payments via an excel file which is based on the PC Man account numbers as you can see in the excel file attached. The file for invoices &credits is created by PC Man Accounting / Accounting Report Generator. The file of payments is created out of GP. I guess with PC Man sunset no more PC Man bill to numbers will exist? Datev account number have 6 digits starting with a 6. Is there any way to solve this problem? Besides the point reporting we would need a file (credits & invoices) like the one which is created by Accounting Report Generator as well. I [Germany AR] just have called Mr. Pachnerand got confirmed: as soon as we arrived at 6digits SNG bill to numbers these can be used ( as they start with 1XXXXX?) anddo not need to be “converted” …. this will be working up to 499999 after our AR test session 2 weeksago I just want to give you a small feedback on the meeting we had with Mr.Pachner last week concerning import of our invoice file to Datev. Datev account numbers have 6digits starting with a 6 but the number 5 would work as well. Until now the report of invoicescoming out PC Man (Accounting/C Accounting Report Generator) changed the 9 ofPC Man bill to numbers to 6 automatically: 923893 => 623893 As far as I understood correctlySGN bill to numbers will only be used in future. So Mr. Pachner came up with thefollowing solution: He will discontinue the PC Manaccount numbers at a special date & and set up the SGN ones starting with a5 (as the 6 already has been in use until now and we would need unique bill tonumbers ) and fill up 0 to 6 digits. _  SGN bill to  9947(until now shown in Datev as 623893- PC Man number 923893) -this would beentered to Datev with 509947… _  SGN bill to 1045 - thiswould be entered to Dated with 501045 Please, would it be possible tocreate the invoice file – equivalent to the one we are using right now- with the SGN bill to numbers converted automatically to what Datev needs?Would it be possible to make thischange at the end of 2015? If it will be done during thisyear this will probably cause big confusion on customers  & our sidewhen we send out requests for confirmation of balance due to the audit we willhave next year.

Good Example invoice in our AR App is the one for Customer 1767 - Arrow Central GMBH, (search on Order number 22800389) ",The body of the invoices on pages 1 thru -1 of the last page are completely utilizing the page space that is reserved for the footer. The body of the invoices on pages 2 thru the last page are completely utilizing the page space that is reserved for the header. ,,,,message does not appear when I hit save from a user settings change.,,"As an AR associate, I want the end date calendar to be on the same month as the start date so I don't have to scroll to the month every time.  This only applies if an end date was not already chosen.","Given I select a Start Date, the End Date calendar should open and have the same selected month as the start date.",Go through the services to increase the activitytracing in the other services.,Ensure a class and add a message log.,* Provided feedback has been updated. See attached. As an AR associate I want the currency list limited based on the currencies that Samtec uses during billing.,"Given I run a report and select a company, the currency list shows, USD, EURO, PDS, RMB/CNY.",All the PCMan invoice put together for the shipment ID / Tracking number should match up to the total of our AR Application invoice. The AR Application invoice should not show an additional page with no information on it. ,,Given a search result window with all invoices selected when I run a new search those should be unmarked."As an AR associate that receives application driven emails, I want the customer billing name added into the subject line so that I can tell what customer the invoice was for without opening the invoice attachments or trying to search in AR application. ","Given the AR Application sends an invoice send error message to the AR group email address, when I look in Outlook at that message, then I should see the invoice number and the customers billing name. Given the AR application delivers an invoice to a customer via email, when they look at the subject line of the message, then they should see the invoice number and the customer billing name. Given AR associate is emailing invoices from the AR Application, when they are generating the email, then the default subject line should include the invoice number and the customer billing name. "As a AR associate I want to be able to search on multiple items at one time.  For ex: 180 and Arrow could be entered into the search box and results would show where both items are found in a single record.,"given an ar app search, when I have the need to further filter my results, I should be able to add that additional criteria to the search box and hit enter to filter down the results.","* Our Company name in the letterhead was spelled with both small and bigcap.  Please synchronized. * Please revised our address to add another unit to 1 Kallang Sector#05-01/02. * The font size of Samtec logo, Company name and address look “petty” ascompare to other items on the invoice.  Please enlarge. * Please align the SOLD TO and address box same as that of the TAX INVOICEinformation. * Please move the Customer Name and Address under INVOICE TO one linespace upwards so that these information fit well within the window of themailing envelope. * Box width of SHIP TO cannot accommodate 31 characters causing the flowdown to next line.  Probably we need to fix it by using smaller font? * "Modify a record in the database so data is appropriate.,* Conversion to SGD is only for tax invoices billed with GST.  If there is no GST to be imposed all amounts should remain in USD and no GST exchange rate should appear. This conversion and GST information are strictly for billing with GST and for Singapore customers only.  Converting all invoices to SGD will confused customers outside Singapore. * "As an AR Associate using Prod, I cannot pull up a rendering for the SMD Technology customer.

VAT ID is not needed if wecharge VAT. Regards Anna The customer VAT ID allows us tosend the goods to the customer (located in the EU) without charging german VAT.  As soon as a customer can´t giveus a VAT ID, we need to charge german VAT.  For shipments to Germany wedon’t need the VAT ID from the customer, as we always have to charge german VATfor these shipments. FOR INSURANCE CALCULATION THIS IS HOW PCMAN OPERATES It appears that when a shipmentgoes through naship, if the CUSTMAST (billing) record has a “Y” or “I” in theINSURANCE field (for Yes or International, I presume), then it will addinsurance.  If the insurance field was “Y” then it uses an insurance factor(nIns) of 0.25; if it was “I” it uses 0.38.  The calculation is: Insurance value :=(int((nCVGoods/100) + .99)) * nIns Where nCVGoods is the value ofthe goods converted from USD to the end currency. So say for example, the totalprice without insurance (nTotalP) is 80 Euro, then: Insurance :=(int(80/100)+.99)*nIns Int(80/100) is zero, so assumingthe customer is set up for international insurance: Insurance:= (0 + 0.99) * 0.38 Insurance:= 0.3762 Euro "
