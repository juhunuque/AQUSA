Germany - As you may know we are working with an external accountant who is working with DATEV. He imports all our invoices and payments via an excel file which is based on the PC Man account numbers as you can see in the excel file attached. The file for invoices &credits is created by PC Man Accounting / Accounting Report Generator. The file of payments is created out of GP. I guess with PC Man sunset no more PC Man bill to numbers will exist? Datev account number have 6 digits starting with a 6. Is there any way to solve this problem? Besides the point reporting we would need a file (credits & invoices) like the one which is created by Accounting Report Generator as well. I [Germany AR] just have called Mr. Pachnerand got confirmed: as soon as we arrived at 6digits SNG bill to numbers these can be used ( as they start with 1XXXXX?) anddo not need to be ÐconvertedÓ €. this will be working up to 499999 after our AR test session 2 weeksago I just want to give you a small feedback on the meeting we had with Mr.Pachner last week concerning import of our invoice file to Datev. Datev account numbers have 6digits starting with a 6 but the number 5 would work as well. Until now the report of invoicescoming out PC Man (Accounting/C Accounting Report Generator) changed the 9 ofPC Man bill to numbers to 6 automatically: 923893 => 623893 As far as I understood correctlySGN bill to numbers will only be used in future. So Mr. Pachner came up with thefollowing solution: He will discontinue the PC Manaccount numbers at a special date & and set up the SGN ones starting with a5 (as the 6 already has been in use until now and we would need unique bill tonumbers ) and fill up 0 to 6 digits. __ SGN bill to _9947(until now shown in Datev as 623893- PC Man number 923893) -this would beentered to Datev with 509947€ __ SGN bill to 1045 - thiswould be entered to Dated with 501045 Please, would it be possible tocreate the invoice file _ equivalent to the one we are using right now-_with the SGN bill to numbers converted automatically to what Datev needs?Would it be possible to make thischange at the end of 2015? If it will be done during thisyear this will probably cause big confusion on customers _& our sidewhen we send out requests for confirmation of balance due to the audit we willhave next year.
